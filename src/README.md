# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


Creating a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CDK for deploying a Lambda function and API Gateway from a GitHub repository is a great approach for automating your infrastructure deployment. Your suggestion to use AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) along with a buildspec.yaml file is a good strategy. This approach allows you to keep your pipeline code generic while providing flexibility in your serverless application deployment. [1]

Here's a recommended approach:

In your GitHub repository:

Include your Lambda function code

Create an AWS SAM template (template.yaml) to define your Lambda and API Gateway resources

Add a buildspec.yaml file for AWS CodeBuild

In your CDK code:

Define the CodePipeline with stages for source (GitHub), build, and deploy [2]

Here's an example of how you might structure this:

In your GitHub repo, create a buildspec.yaml:

version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.8
  build:
    commands:
      - sam build
  post_build:
    commands:
      - sam deploy --no-confirm-changeset --no-fail-on-empty-changeset

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'

In your CDK code, create the pipeline:

import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as codecommit from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-codecommit';
import * as codepipeline from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-codepipeline';
import * as codepipeline_actions from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-codepipeline-actions';
import * as codebuild from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-codebuild';

export class CicdPipelineStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create a CodePipeline
    const pipeline = new codepipeline.Pipeline(this, 'Pipeline', {
      pipelineName: 'MyServerlessPipeline',
    });

    // Add source stage
    const sourceOutput = new codepipeline.Artifact();
    const sourceAction = new codepipeline_actions.GitHubSourceAction({
      actionName: 'GitHub_Source',
      owner: 'your-github-username',
      repo: 'your-repo-name',
      oauthToken: cdk.SecretValue.secretsManager('github-oauth-token'),
      output: sourceOutput,
      branch: 'main',
    });
    pipeline.addStage({
      stageName: 'Source',
      actions: [sourceAction],
    });

    // Add build stage
    const buildProject = new codebuild.PipelineProject(this, 'BuildProject', {
      environment: {
        buildImage: codebuild.LinuxBuildImage.AMAZON_LINUX_2_3,
      },
      environmentVariables: {
        'PACKAGE_BUCKET': {
          value: 'your-sam-artifact-bucket-name',
        },
      },
    });

    const buildOutput = new codepipeline.Artifact();
    const buildAction = new codepipeline_actions.CodeBuildAction({
      actionName: 'CodeBuild',
      project: buildProject,
      input: sourceOutput,
      outputs: [buildOutput],
    });

    pipeline.addStage({
      stageName: 'Build',
      actions: [buildAction],
    });

    // Add deploy stage
    const deployAction = new codepipeline_actions.CloudFormationCreateUpdateStackAction({
      actionName: 'Deploy',
      templatePath: buildOutput.atPath('packaged.yaml'),
      stackName: 'my-serverless-stack',
      adminPermissions: true,
    });

    pipeline.addStage({
      stageName: 'Deploy',
      actions: [deployAction],
    });
  }
}

This approach offers several benefits:

Separation of concerns: Your application code and infrastructure-as-code are separate but linked.

Flexibility: You can easily update your Lambda function or API Gateway configuration by modifying the SAM template.

Consistency: The buildspec.yaml ensures consistent builds across different environments.

Scalability: This pattern can be easily extended to include multiple serverless applications or additional deployment stages.

Remember to:

Set up the necessary IAM permissions for your pipeline to access your GitHub repository and deploy resources.

Store your GitHub OAuth token securely in AWS Secrets Manager.

Ensure your SAM template (template.yaml) correctly defines your Lambda function and API Gateway.

This setup provides a solid foundation for automating the deployment of your serverless applications using AWS CDK and SAM.
